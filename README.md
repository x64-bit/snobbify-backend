Get your Spotify profile roasted by chatGPT!

This repo is a lightly modified version of [Spotify's authorization code example](https://github.com/spotify/web-api-examples/tree/master/authorization/authorization_code) with additional redirects and endpoints for OpenAI API calls. (Code for refresh tokens exists, but too lazy to implement properly.) Implemented using Node/Express and the OpenAI API.
